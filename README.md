# BaseKorean
Converts a number into a set of Korean characters that represents that number.

Korean characters have over 11,000 permutations per "digit" or syllabic unit. 
This means that Korean characters have a huge potential to condense the length of large numbers. 
I can't really think of anything specifically useful for this concept, but I thought it was a funny idea.
